# Auto-Generation Feature - Learning Paths

## What Changed

The Learning Path Generator now automatically generates personalized learning paths when students first visit the page, based on their education level.

## How It Works

### 1. Education Level Detection
When the page loads, the component:
- Fetches the student's education level from `user_details` table
- Determines if they are School (Grades 1-12) or College/University

### 2. Smart Interest Selection

**For School Students:**
- **Grades 1-5**: Recycling, Water Conservation, Wildlife Protection
- **Grades 6-8**: Climate Change, Water Conservation, Recycling  
- **Grades 9-12**: Climate Change, Renewable Energy, Sustainable Agriculture

**For College Students:**
- Climate Change, Renewable Energy, Green Technology

### 3. Automatic Path Generation
- If student has saved interests → Uses those
- If no saved interests → Auto-selects based on education level
- Immediately generates 3 personalized learning paths using AI
- Shows loading indicator during generation

## User Experience

### Initial Load
1. Student navigates to "Learning Paths" tab
2. Sees loading message: "Generating Your Personalized Learning Paths"
3. Interests are auto-selected based on education level
4. 3 learning paths appear automatically
5. Green message shows: "✨ Auto-selected topics for [Grade X] students"

### After Initial Load
- Students can modify interests
- Click "Generate Paths" to regenerate
- Click "Regenerate" to get new paths with same interests

## Benefits

✅ **Zero Friction**: Students see relevant content immediately  
✅ **Age-Appropriate**: Interests match educational maturity  
✅ **Personalized**: AI generates paths based on level and interests  
✅ **Flexible**: Students can still customize interests  
✅ **Smart Caching**: Saved interests used on return visits

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions

**`getDefaultInterests(eduLevel)`**
- Returns 3 default interests based on education level
- Handles both school grades and college levels

**`initializeComponent()`**
- Fetches education level
- Fetches enrolled paths
- Auto-generates paths on first load

**`autoGeneratePaths(selectedInterests)`**
- Calls `/api/learning-paths` with auto-selected interests
- Silent error handling (logs but doesn't show errors)
- Sets loading state

### State Management
- `hasAutoGenerated`: Prevents duplicate auto-generation
- `educationLevel`: Stores student's education level
- `isGenerating`: Shows loading indicator
